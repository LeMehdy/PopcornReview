# Project description :

In the era of digital entertainment, movies have taken center stage as a primary
source of leisure and cultural engagement. When people want to do a critical
analysis, or simply share opinions, they are increasingly turning to websites
dedicated to movie ratings and reviews. A website where users can rate movies is a
dynamic online platform designed to foster a community of film enthusiasts, critics,
and casual viewers alike. This digital space serves as a hub for movie lovers to
discover, discuss, and evaluate films of various genres, eras, and cultural
backgrounds.
